# Locamatic
Locamatic is a tool to automatically configure your Mac based on its network location.
Have you ever wished that your Mac would update its location automatically on the basis of the network that you're currently connected to? Perhaps you use your Mac at work accessing the internet through a proxy server, and also at home where you have none. It isn't difficult to select a new location from the Location menu in the Apple menu, but why should you have to? Locamatic will do all this for you!
