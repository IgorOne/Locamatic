      <p class="introprimtextlongtext">
        So you found a bug?  Excellent work!  I'm delighted.  Of course, now you have to get your specimen into the lab so that it can be classified and examined thoroughly.
      </p>
      <p class="introprimtextlongtext">
        The first thing to do is to fire up your email program and write an e-mail that accurately describes the nature of your bug:
      </p>
      <ul class="square">
        <li>
          <span class="introprimtextlongtext">
            Did the program crash? 
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="introprimtextlongtext">
            Did the icon disappear from the menubar (assuming that you didn't explicitly hide it, of course)? 
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="introprimtextlongtext">
            Did the icon remain in the menubar - but unresponsive to your clicks? 
          </span>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="introprimtextlongtext">
        If you're a geek (or if you're feeling brave), you could fire up Console (it's an app in the Utilities folder of your Mac) and send me the error logs relating to Locamatic.
      </p>
      <p class="introprimtextlongtext">
        Next, describe the circumstances of the crash.
      </p>
      <ul class="square">
        <li>
          <span class="introprimtextlongtext">
            Did the crash happen immediately? 
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="introprimtextlongtext">
            Did it happen when another program was loaded? 
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="introprimtextlongtext">
            Does it happen when you connect to a particular network, or select a particular printer or homepage? 
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="introprimtextlongtext">
            How long had Locamatic been running when the crash occurred? 
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="introprimtextlongtext">
            How long had your Mac been running when the crash occurred? 
          </span>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="introprimtextlongtext">
        Remember, this isn't an exhaustive list of the information that you need include in your crash report.  This is just a list of a few things to consider when filing your report.
      </p>
      <p class="introprimtextlongtext">
        Finally, include details of your computer:
      </p>
      <ul class="square">
        <li>
          <span class="introprimtextlongtext">
            The model of your Mac. 
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="introprimtextlongtext">
            The amount of memory that your Mac has. 
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="introprimtextlongtext">
            The size of your hard drive, and the available free space. 
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="introprimtextlongtext">
            The version of Mac OS that you're running - and please be as precise as you can. 
          </span>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="introprimtextlongtext"> 
        You can find this information in the Apple Menu, About this Mac.
      </p>
      <p class="introprimtextlongtext">
        Send your completed bug report to <a href="mailto: support@45rpmsoftware.com?Subject=Locamatic%20Bug%20Report">support@45rpmsoftware.com</a>.
      </p>
      <p class="introprimtextlongtext">
        In return, I will carefully examine your bug report, get back to you for more information if I require it, and fix the problem.  I promise that I won't drop your email on the floor and ignore it.
