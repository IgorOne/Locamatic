        All of Locamatic's settings are controlled by its Preference Pane.  You can load the Preference Pane by selecting 'Preferences…' from the Locamatic menu, or by selecting 'System Preferences…' from the Apple menu, and then clicking on the Locamatic icon (you'll find it in the bottom segment of the System Preferences window).

            Turning Locamatic Off and On. 
          </b>
          The On-Off slider turns Locamatic On and Off.  If you slide it and it returns to its original position after a second or two then there's a problem with Locamatic - so <a href="reportingbugs.html">seek help</a>!

            Enabling Locamatic. 
          </b>
          You can set Locamatic to be On (whether launched manually, or at start), but inactive.  If the Enabled checkbox is ticked then Locamatic will work its magic.  If it isn't ticked then Locamatic will do nothing.
        </p>

            Launching Locamatic automatically. 
          </b>
          If Launch on Start is ticked then Locamatic will load itself automatically when you start your Mac up.  If this checkbox isn't ticked then you will need to turn Locamatic on manually when you turn on your computer.

            Displaying the Locamatic menu item. 
          </b>
          By default, Locamatic will show its icon in the menubar as long as it is loaded. If you have a very cluttered menubar you might prefer to turn off the menu icon.  You can toggle this setting using the 'Show Menu Item' checkbox. Locamatic will still work, even if the menu item isn't displayed.

            The Location List. 
          </b>
          The Location List displays the list of Locations that you have previously configured on your computer. You’ll need to have set up your locations beforehand for Locamatic to be useful.  Locations are set up in the Network Preferences pane in the System Preferences application.  The instructions for configuring Locations can be found <a href="file:///Library/Documentation/Help/MacHelp.help/Contents/Resources/en.lproj/redirect.html?topic=mchlp1175">here</a>.
        <p class="introprimtextlongtext">

            Gateway or SSID. 
          </b>
          The Gateway or SSID setting configures how Locamatic recognises what network you've connected to.  If you've selected the 'Automatic' location you won't be able to select Gateways or SSIDs.  The reason for this is that 'Automatic' is the default Location - Locamatic will use the Automatic location whenever your computer connects to a SSID that it doesn't know about.
        </p>
        <p class="introprimtextlongtext">
          Configuring SSIDs (the name of your Wireless network) is a doddle.  Provided you've connected to the SSID in the past, you can simply select the SSID that you want to configure from the menu. 
	</p>
        <p class="introprimtextlongtext">
          Gateways (or Routers), which can be thought of as being like a SSID* (but for a wired Ethernet network), are a little harder to configure. You need to know what the gateway (or router) address is for the network that you're connecting to.  You can find this information out yourself by viewing the Network preference pane and writing down the IP address for the Router.  Key this number into Locamatic exactly as it appears in the network control panel.

          *I know, I know. This is a gross simplification. Bear with me - I'm trying to keep this simple!

          If you select a printer here then this printer will become your default printer whenever Locamatic sets this location.

            Homepage. 
          </b>
          If you select a homepage here then this will become your default homepage whenever Locamatic sets this location. Please note that this homepage setting only applies to Apple's Safari web browser.  
	<p class="introprimtextlongtext">
          The homepage menu comes pre-populated with a selection of popular search engines (and if you haven't tried DuckDuckGo then your probably should!) If your favourite web page isn't listed here you can add it just by typing in the URL.
